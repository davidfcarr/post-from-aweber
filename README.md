# aweber-post

WordPress plugin: Create a blog post based on the archive page for an AWeber email broadcast. Strips out extraneous HTML such as table coding. Allows you to edit the results in the WordPress editor. Appears as a Classic Block in the Gutenberg editor, but you can "convert to blocks" if desired.
