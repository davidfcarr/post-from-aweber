Create a blog post based on the archive page for an AWeber email broadcast.

== Description ==

If you create valuable content in your AWeber email newsletters or other email broadcasts, this plugin simplifies the process of republishing that content to your blog.

Just paste the url for the AWeber archive page into the AWeber Post screen (a submenu under Posts) and click Get.

The content import process strips out extraneous HTML such as table coding. 

Allows you to edit the results in the WordPress editor. 

Appears as a Classic Block in the Gutenberg editor, but you can "convert to blocks" if desired.

Problem it solves: copy-and-paste from an AWeber archive page into the WordPress editor does not work well, and manually editing the HTML code is difficult because of the use of nested tables for formatting.

This plugin is for AWeber users, but the company behind that service is not responsible for any issues with this code.
